# Course Description

Are we living in a "New Dark Age?” Artist and writer James Bridle argues that the abundance of information intended to enlighten the world has, in practice, darkened it. This course will take a big picture look at the interconnected impact of technology on the world around us. Is it enough to learn to code or think computationally? Are we simply at the mercy of unstable and inevitable technological progress? How can we think and act with justice and agency in a world where there is too much to know? How can we uncover the hidden material traces of technology in our surroundings? Through research, hands-on assignments, and local trips, we will seek to understand what has led to our present technological moment and where we can go from here. We will cover topics such as climate change, e-waste, big data, algorithmic bias, and automation. Our goal will be to create new metaphors for understanding the systems around us.

We do have an [ebook](https://wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01WLU_INST/r69n1a/alma991010570127204161) for this title available, but unfortunately it comes with a restrictive license. Only one person can access the book at a time. :(

## Grading




## Accommodations
I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your individual needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations.

If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two days of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam.

Captions for recorded lectures can be viewed through YuJa or using the Powerpoint Subtitles feature. 

## Plagiarism & AI Policy
All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation. For more info: http://libguides.wlu.edu/plagiarism

In this course, you should only use generative AI tools (this includes Grammarly, ChatGPT, Claude) when explicitly specified in the assignment or activity instructions. If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. Please cite the tool according to the guidelines for citing computer software, as outlined in the designated style guide. Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool.

It is your responsibility — not the tool’s — to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course.
Misuse or unauthorized usage of generative AI tools may constitute an Honor Violation, which can be further expounded in the White Book. Please communicate with me if there is any confusion regarding its usage for assignments, assessments, or any other coursework.
Please maintain integrity, for your learning, your personal character, and academic record.
