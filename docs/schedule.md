Participate 
{: .label .label-yellow } 

Everything with this label are activities you should do on the day if possible. Discussion questions are meant to prompt conversation. You don't have to answer every one, instead, look for ways to engage with the ideas of your classmates. 

Read/Watch 
{: .label .label-green }

Readings and recorded lectures will appear with this label. They should be done on the day listed if possible.	

Reflect 
{: .label .label-purple }
Reflections are thinking/writing prompts that will not be turned in. I encourage you to take some time away from screen to your answers by hand. If you want some accountability or feedback, you can take a picture of your writing or copy and paste and send it to me directly on Slack. You could also send yourself a message on Slack!
