    "title": "Cognitive Skills + Grading",
    "content": "This course will focus on developing three essential cognitive skills: information literacy, systems thinking, and meta-cognition. Each assignment will ask you to demonstrate some combination of these skills. Our grading system will reflect your ability to 1) meet the prompt and 2) display evidence of these skills. We’ll discuss and reference these skills throughout the course. Information Literacy is the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, the use of information in creating new knowledge, and the ethical participation in communities of learning. (Adapted from the ACRL Framework) . “Systems thinking is a way of seeing and talking about reality that helps us better understand and work with systems to influence the quality of our lives.” (Daniel H. Kim) In contrast to a linear perspective, systems thinking understands that there a lot of pieces at play in any situation/system that can all have different effects. Meta-cognition is thinking about thinking. Specifically, “thinking about the contents and processes of one’s mind.” (Winne and Azvedo) It’s a key part of the learning process to reflect what’s happening during/after the experience. ",

    "content": "We will use an adapted version of Specifications Grading, an alternative grading system. The goals of the system are to reduce the stress and mystery of grades while also raising academic standards. I chose this system to complement the technology we’ll be using/learning this term, to reduce grade anxiety, and to fit with our condensed four-week schedule. If you’d like to learn more, here’s a resource from UN-Lincoln. Each assignment will be worth 3-6 points. You will receive 1 point for turning in the assignment and meeting the prompt (meaning it’s on time and it fulfills the mechanics of what is being asked). You will receive 1 point for evidence of each cognitive skill that is mapped to the assignment (see table below). Finally, you’ll receive up to 2 engagement points. 1 point for attending and participating in class that week and another for presenting on your assignments, engaging with course readings and discussion, etc. Each assignment will have specific suggestions for ways to demonstrate the skill.

In New Dark Age, Bridle calls for “new metaphors: a metalanguage for describing the world that complex systems have wrought.” We’ve learned the reasons why “cloud” is an insufficient metaphor for the physical network it represents. We’ve seen examples of other metaphors created by companies and theorists. And we’ve seen visualizations of these metaphors from artists and others (I like Dan Nott’s personally). In this assignment, you will be challenged to come up with your own new metaphor for a modern technological artifact or phenomenon of your choosing. The form of this assignment will be the “unessay.” You will decide, with the help of the class, the best presentation for your new metaphor, so long as it is compelling and effective. While we don’t do a formal proposal process, let’s chat through your ideas as soon as you’re ready. Feeling uninspired?

Are we simply at the mercy of unstable and inevitable technological progress? How can we think and act with justice and agency in a world where there is too much to know? How can we uncover the hidden material traces of technology in our surroundings? Through research, hands-on assignments, and local trips, we will seek to understand what has led to our present technological moment and where we can go from here. We will cover topics such as climate change, e-waste, big data, algorithmic bias, and automation. Our goal will be to create new metaphors for understanding the systems around us. ",
