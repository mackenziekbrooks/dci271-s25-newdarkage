You will select a single piece of technology and research its creation, impact, and decline. Maybe you’ve heard jokes about Betamax or wondered what happened to all the phone booths – this is your chance to find out! Your findings will be compiled in a 700-1000 word essay, to be published on our course website. You are encouraged to use images and video to illustrate your essay. This is a research-intensive assignment – you will be required to find, use, and assess 5-7 sources. A video introduction to this assignment is available on Canvas. ",

    "content": "In chapter 5, Bridle writes about psycho-geography and his search for “the places where the great networks of digital technologies become steel and wire.” In this assignment, you will uncover the hidden traces of technology in our local surroundings. Armed with knowledge from our readings and guests in Week 3, you will identify 4-5 sites of material technology in the landscape and document it for the course website. You’ll place each site on a map so we can see the fuller picture of your local infrastructure. Your documentation should include photos, video, and 50-100 words that address the following questions: . | What made you notice this site? | Why did you select it? | What’s happening? | What is the technology at play? | Who owns the land and who is being serviced? | Who is benefiting and who is not? | How can you find out more information about this site? | What can’t you find and why? | . Originally, this assignment was going to be a scavenger hunt through campus and Rockbridge County. Since most of you are no longer on campus, this map has new potential! But it means you’ll have to conduct your own research and rely on local sources of information. I’ll walk you through some of the options in the video for this assignment, but consider the following: . | local newspapers | local property records | ask your family members or friends | local government meeting minutes or other documents | . Finally, go outside (if you can do so safely)! The goal of this assignment is to open your eyes to things in our surroundings that hidden in plain sight. ",

    "content": "In New Dark Age, Bridle calls for “new metaphors: a metalanguage for describing the world that complex systems have wrought.” For instance, we’ve learned the reasons why “cloud” is an insufficient metaphor for the physical network it represents. We’ve seen examples of other metaphors created by companies and theorists. And we’ve seen visualizations of these metaphors from artists and others (I like Dan Nott’s personally). In this assignment, you will be challenged to come up with your own new metaphor for a modern technological artifact or phenomenon of your choosing. The form of this assignment will be the “unessay.” You will decide, with the help of the class, the best presentation for your new metaphor, so long as it is compelling and effective. While we don’t do a formal proposal process, let’s chat through your ideas as soon as you’re ready. Feeling uninspired? Check out these examples from a course called “Technologies of Text” by Prof. Ryan Cordell. ",

In terms of presentation, an unessay is effective when it shows some combination of these attributes: . | it is readable/watchable/listenable (i.e. the production values are appropriately high and the audience is not distracted by avoidable lapses in presentation) | it is appropriate (i.e. it uses a format and medium that suits its topic and approach) | it is attractive (i.e. it is presented in a way that leads the audience to trust the author and his or her arguments, examples, and conclusions). | .

This course will take a big picture look at the interconnected impact of technology on the world around us. Is it enough to learn to code or think computationally? Are we simply at the mercy of unstable and inevitable technological progress? How can we think and act with justice and agency in a world where there is too much to know? How can we uncover the hidden material traces of technology in our surroundings? Through research, hands-on assignments, and local trips, we will seek to understand what has led to our present technological moment and where we can go from here. We will cover topics such as climate change, e-waste, big data, algorithmic bias, and automation. Our goal will be to create new metaphors for understanding the systems around us. ",
